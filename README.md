Description of module:

Module is used for creating web map with 10 nearest filming locations to user, 
depending on user's coordinates. All films are based on user's chosen year.

The info is based on 'locations.csv' - file with all filming location,
'concap.csv' - file with all capitals, 'countries_cooridinates.csv' - file with
coordinates of countries, 'city_coordinates' - file with coordinates of cities.
As a result, user gets html file with web map.

"<head>" defines a container with head elements
"<body>" includes visual content of web map
"<meta>" is used for metadata of document
"<script>" contains user's script(as JavaScript)
"<style>" contains style of tags, style info for a document
